# Definition:

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

# Methods to insert a new node.

A node can be added in three ways:

1. At the front of the linked list
2. After a given node.
3. At the end of the linked list.
